This is a python script to find registered voters in the state of florida. This is assuming you know the first and last name and not the DOB. The script parses through whatever range you give it for the persons DOB and searches the dept of State database of the name.

Important things:

1) This is for the state of Florida, which only needs first name, last name, and DOB to search its database. Other states have different requriements (i.e county, zip-code)
2) Keeping in mind above, you will need to change the script to parse different states correctly
3) If the range data is broad, the site might time you out for trying too many requests, if so you need to modify the script to get around potential spam filters. Have not tested this for other state websites so im not sure how it boads.
4) DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR MALICIOUS INTENT. I DO NOT CONDONE USING THIS SCRIPT TO FIND PRIVATE INFORMATION OF PEOPLE. USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMATION FOUND OR WHATS DONE USING SAID FOUND INFORMATION.
